			<p>The Jedi are not warriors, though they are trained in combat.<br>
				They are not rulers, though they wield great power.<br>
				They are guardiansâ€”of peace, of life, of balance.<br>
				<br>
				To be a Jedi is to surrender the self.<br>
				To quiet the storm within so that others may know calm.<br>
				To seek understanding over victory, harmony over dominance.<br>
				<br>
				You will be tested. Not by the blade, but by the choices that will cost you comfort, pride, even love.<br>
				<br>
				This is not a path of glory.<br>
				It is a path of sacrifice.<br>

				Are you ready to learn what it truly means to be a Jedi?</p>
