			<p>The Sith do not ask for permission.<br>
				They do not kneel to councils or creeds.<br>
				They take what they need, because power is not given—it is seized.<br>
				<br>
				To be a Sith is to embrace passion.<br>
				To feel fully. To burn brighter.<br>
				Love, rage, ambition—all fuel for the fire that makes you more.<br>
				<br>
				They will call you dangerous. Reckless. Evil.<br>
				But the truth? The galaxy fears those who cannot be controlled.<br>
				<br>
				This is not a path of restraint.<br>
				It is a path of power—and the will to use it.<br>

				Do you dare to understand what it truly means to be a Sith?</p>
